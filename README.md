# House-prices-EDA-python-project
this repository contains the EDA of  Pakistan Houses prices found on kaggle
The main purpose of EDA is to help look at data before making any assumptions. It can help identify obvious errors, as well as better understand patterns within the data, detect outliers or anomalous events, and find interesting relations among the variables.

In order to perform an Exploratory data analysis of this house market data set, I explored new visualization techniques such as violin plot, correlation matrix and density plots as well as key statistical concepts and formulas from the Practical Statistics for Data Scientist book first chapter.
